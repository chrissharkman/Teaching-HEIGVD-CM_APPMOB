Details to follow.

## Known Issues

* [Ionic View App Issue #10: Upload doesn't seem to be updating JS or CSS files](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-view-issues/issues/10)

  If you are using the Ionic View App to develop your mobile application on iOS,
  be aware that sometimes uploading is not enough to refresh your code on the device.
  You might need to stop your app (swipe down with three fingers), clear app data,
  and restart the Ionic View App (double tap on home button and close Ionic View App).
  Then you can re-download your app and it should be the latest version.
